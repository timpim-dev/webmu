## How it works

Nostalgist.js wraps libretro cores compiled to WebAssembly via Emscripten for the classic systems. EmulatorJS handles the heavier ones, PlayStation, PSP, N64, and DS. Cover art is fetched from the libretro-thumbnails CDN on jsDelivr. ROMs in the collection are stored in IndexedDB locally on your device and never leave it. Game metadata and profile data sync to PocketBase on your server.

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Whisingdilli71/webemu.git
cd webemu
open index.html
```

No build step. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.

## PocketBase Setup
- Set `PB_URL` in `Scripts/collection.js` to your PocketBase URL.
- Create an auth collection named `webmuser`, or change `PB_AUTH_COLLECTION` to match your auth collection name.
- Add auth fields for `name`, `photoBase64`, `lastDevice`, and `lastSeen`.
- Create a `games` collection with fields for `owner` as a relation to the auth collection, plus `name`, `system`, and `coverUrl`.

For PSP and N64, SharedArrayBuffer headers are required. Run locally with:
```bash
npx serve . --config serve.json
```

With a `serve.json` containing COOP and COEP headers. On Netlify, add a `netlify.toml` with the same headers. I have provided the one I have used. And in serve.json, use the same headers IF you want to use locally.
